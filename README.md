# Prediction-of-heart-stroke-in-diabetic-patients
Nowadays in the medical field,it is essential to predict diseases early to 
prevent them. Diabetes is one of the most chronic diseases all over the world. 
In today's lifestyles, sugar and fat are typically included in our dietary habits, 
which increases the risk of diabetes. Diabetes,a prevalent metabolic disorder, 
is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular complications, including heart 
strokes. Early detection and proactive management of heart stroke risk in 
diabetic patients can substantially improve their overall cardiovascular health 
and reduce the incidence of life-threatening events.Our project leverages 
machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree,Random Forest and Light 
Gradient Boosting Machine(LGBM) algorithms to analyze comprehensive 
datasets comprising medical history, lifestyle factors, and physiological 
parameters of diabetic individuals. The model integrates various features such
as blood glucose levels, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and demographic 
information.The Heart-stroke Prediction model not only identifies individuals 
at high risk of strokes but also provides actionable insights for healthcare 
professionals to tailor preventive strategies.The outcomes of this project 
contribute to the growing field of predictive healthcare analytics, 
demonstrating the potential of machine learning in improving diagnostic 
accuracy and optimizing resource allocation in the healthcare sector.
